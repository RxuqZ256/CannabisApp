# CannabisApp

## Overview
CannabisApp is a simple prototype for a cannabis comparison application. The repository currently contains a basic HTML page which can be expanded into a full mobile app.

## Building the iOS version
To build an iOS app using this codebase you can wrap the project with a hybrid framework (for example Cordova) and compile it with Xcode:

1. Install **Xcode** from the Mac App Store.
2. Install Cordova globally with `npm install -g cordova` or use your preferred framework.
3. Run `cordova platform add ios` inside this repository to create the iOS project.
4. Open `platforms/ios/*.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
5. Build and run the application in the simulator or on a device.
