# CannabisApp

This repository now contains a simple SwiftUI iOS project.

## Running the iOS app

1. Open **iOS/CannabisApp.xcodeproj** in Xcode.
2. Select an iOS simulator or a connected device.
3. Press the **Run** button or use `Cmd+R` to build and launch the app.

The app shows a basic `ContentView` with a greeting message.
